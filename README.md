# Wifi-Signal-Check
I created this program while learning python to check my internet signal strength, transmit rate, and receive rate.

I was running the following:
  * Windows 10, OS build 19041.450.
  * Python 3.8.5 (64-bit)

It uses a command line call to check the signal strength (%), transmit and receive (Mbps) rate of your network.

To use this project:
  1) save signal-check.py & read_write_output.py into a folder
  2) create a subfolder called "python_work"
  3) double-click signal-check.py
  4) wait
  
  
It should create the file "signal_output.csv" inside the same folder as signal-check.py
