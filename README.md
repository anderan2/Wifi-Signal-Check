# Wifi-Signal-Check
I created this program while learning python to check my internet signal strength, transmit rate, and receive rate.

I was running the following:
  * Windows 10, OS build 19041.450.
  * Python 3.8.5 (64-bit)

It uses a command line call to check the signal strength (%), transmit and receive (Mbps) rate of your network.

To use this project:
  1) Create a folder called "signal-check"
  2) In the signal-check folder, create the following folders:
    a) CSV-file
    b) Input-file
    c) Json-file
    d) Source-code
  3) Inside of Source-code, save signal-check.py & get_wifi_info.py
  4) double click on signal-check.py

After 60 seconds, the .csv will be in the CSV-file folder. Also, a .json file will be in the Json-file folder.

Note: I know that this is still an evolving project with a lot of possible improvements. I'll gradually make
improvements as my comfort with Python improves. Thank you for your patience :)
