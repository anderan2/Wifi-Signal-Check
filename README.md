# Wifi-Signal-Check
I created this program while learning python to check my internet signal strength, transmit rate, and receive rate.

I was running the following:
  * Windows 10, OS build 19041.450.
  * Python 3.8.5 (64-bit)

It uses a command line call to check the signal strength (%), transmit and receive (Mbps) rate of your network.

To use this project, save signal-check.py onto your desktop and create a folder called "python_work".
