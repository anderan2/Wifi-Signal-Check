# Wifi-Signal-Check
I created this program to check my internet signal strength, transmit rate, and receive rate.

I was running Windows 10, OS build 19041.450.

It uses a command line call to check the signal strength (%), transmit and receive (Mbps) rate of your network.

To use this project, save signal-check.py onto your desktop and create a folder called "python_work".
